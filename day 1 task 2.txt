Here’s the lowdown on IRCTC’s new website
 
FUNCTIONS


*The day/night indication for travel is good.
*Mentioning the total cost on the side is a happy new option, as is the option to check earliest next availability.
*Loved the fact that the list of saved passengers has migrated from the old site to the new 
(the app does not have this feature).
*It is much faster.


How can the performance of IRCTC's website be improved?

*Confused why in the senior citizen option it asks if one wants the 50% discount. 
*Wish the interface was clearer, a page that allows you to see all at one shot.
*log in is such a slow process.
*better architecture, design and implementation at server side
* avoiding congestion and less recovery things are required
*They should provide option to chose seats (upper/lower/middle). Right now it asks for the that but it may not provide 
that desired seat. Instead they must provide visual seat allocation like that of http://bookmyshow.com
